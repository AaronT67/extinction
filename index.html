				<p> The velociraptor roamed the earth nearly 90 million years ago around the end of the cretaceous period. They were part of the dinosaur race that we all know and love today. They were even based in multiple Jurassic films.  Although, there are many facts that were left out about them. They were evolved through time into what we may think they look like that.</p>
				<p>Back in 1924, the president of the American Museum of Natural History, Henry Fairfield Osborn, gave the name “velociraptor” to the creature. The name is driven from the Latin Words “velox”, which means swift, and “raptor”, which is another word for plunderer. It was to be known for its agility. The velociraptor may have been one the races of small dinosaurs. Although, it was said to be quick in hunting and speed was its skill.</p>

				<p> Velociraptor is one of the world's most well-known dinosaurs.The first known Velociraptor fossil was found in the Mongolian Gobi Desert in 1922. Recent research suggests that Velociraptor mongoliensis was a feathered dinosaur. A forelimb fossil discovered in Mongolia showed quill knobs like those found in many modern birds. These telltale features are evidence of where ligaments attached flight feathers to bone and are considered proof that Velociraptor sported a fine feathery coat.</p>
				<p>Velociraptor highlights many of the numerous similarities between dinosaurs and birds, which go far beyond the skin-deep appearance of feathers. Like birds, Velociraptor had hollow bones, tended nests of eggs, and probably behaved in similar ways. Despite their birdlike plumage these dinosaurs were not fliers. Their short forelimbs made liftoff impossible, though they may be the evolutionary remnants of an ancient ancestor's flight-giving wings. Velociraptor was probably one of the more intelligent dinosaurs, because it had a large brain proportionate to its body size.</p>
